  Abstract                 = {Fluctuation theorems are a generalization of thermodynamics on small scales and provide the tools to characterize the fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities in non-equilibrium nanoscale systems. They are particularly important for understanding irreversibility and the second law in fundamental chemical and biological processes that are actively driven, thus operating far from thermal equilibrium. Here, we apply the framework of fluctuation theorems to investigate the important case of a system relaxing from a non-equilibrium state towards equilibrium. Using a vacuum-trapped nanoparticle, we demonstrate experimentally the validity of a fluctuation theorem for the relative entropy change occurring during relaxation from a non-equilibrium steady state. The platform established here allows non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems to be studied experimentally for arbitrary steady states and can be extended to investigate quantum fluctuation theorems as well as systems that do not obey detailed balance.},

  Abstract                 = { We present a method for applying hydrostatic pressure in the computer simulation of nanoparticles, using an ideal gas as the pressure medium and thermostat. As the equation of state is known for the ideal gas, the exerted pressure can easily be tuned by adjusting the number of gas particles, while the temperature is controlled by their kinetic energy. Applying this method, we study the pressure-induced transformation from the four-coordinate wurtzite to the six-coordinate rocksalt structure in faceted CdSe nanocrystals. The transformation involves the consecutive sliding of parallel (100) planes and proceeds through a five-coordinate intermediate structure. },

  Abstract                 = {The Open Visualization Tool (OVITO) is a new 3D visualization software designed for post-processing atomistic data obtained from molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations. Unique analysis, editing and animations functions are integrated into its easy-to-use graphical user interface. The software is written in object-oriented C++, controllable via Python scripts and easily extendable through a plug-in interface. It is distributed as open-source software and can be downloaded from the website http://ovito.sourceforge.net/ [http://ovito.sourceforge.net/] .},
