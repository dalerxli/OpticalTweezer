  Abstract                 = {Fluctuation theorems are a generalization of thermodynamics on small scales and provide the tools to characterize the fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities in non-equilibrium nanoscale systems. They are particularly important for understanding irreversibility and the second law in fundamental chemical and biological processes that are actively driven, thus operating far from thermal equilibrium. Here, we apply the framework of fluctuation theorems to investigate the important case of a system relaxing from a non-equilibrium state towards equilibrium. Using a vacuum-trapped nanoparticle, we demonstrate experimentally the validity of a fluctuation theorem for the relative entropy change occurring during relaxation from a non-equilibrium steady state. The platform established here allows non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems to be studied experimentally for arbitrary steady states and can be extended to investigate quantum fluctuation theorems as well as systems that do not obey detailed balance.},

  Abstract                 = { We present a method for applying hydrostatic pressure in the computer simulation of nanoparticles, using an ideal gas as the pressure medium and thermostat. As the equation of state is known for the ideal gas, the exerted pressure can easily be tuned by adjusting the number of gas particles, while the temperature is controlled by their kinetic energy. Applying this method, we study the pressure-induced transformation from the four-coordinate wurtzite to the six-coordinate rocksalt structure in faceted CdSe nanocrystals. The transformation involves the consecutive sliding of parallel (100) planes and proceeds through a five-coordinate intermediate structure. },

  abstract  = {Metallic objects reflect light and have generally been considered poor candidates for optical traps, particularly with optical tweezers, which rely on a gradient force to provide trapping. We demonstrate that stable trapping can occur with optical tweezers when they are used with small metallic Rayleigh particles. In this size regime, the scattering pictures for metals and dielectrics are similar, and the larger polarizability of metals implies that trapping forces are greater. The latter fact makes the use of metal particles attractive for certain biological applications. Comparison of trapping forces for latex and gold spheres demonstrates that the gradient force is the major determinant of trapping strength and that competing effects, such as scattering or radiometric forces, are relatively minor.},
